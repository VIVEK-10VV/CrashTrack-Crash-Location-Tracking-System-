The Vehicle Collision Alert System enhances road safety by detecting accidents using an STM32 microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor. Upon collision detection, it utilizes GPS to pinpoint the vehicle's location and GSM to send immediate alerts to emergency responders and designated contacts, ensuring rapid assistance
This system uses a microcontroller,gyroscope and accelerometer,gsm module and a gps module.
The microcontroller used here is nucleo-f44re(stm32f44ret6) and mpu6050 is used to
